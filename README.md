### Formula SAE Rear Wing Design and Manufacturing
##### Responsibilities and Achievements:
- Designed and manufactured the rear aerodynamic package for the Auburn FSAE '23 vehicle
- Improved the rear wing downforce to drag ratio from 1.5 in previous years to 2.75.
- Collaborated with an aerodynamics student team to set and fulfill design targets for downforce, drag, weight, and center of pressure location.
- Modeled the rear wing package in a full vehicle assembly to ensure integration of all subsystems.
##### Software Tools and Skills:
- CAD modeling | Siemens NX
- RANS Computational Fluid Dynamics | Siemens STAR-CCM+
- Carbon fiber composites manufacturing
- Manual lathe and mill machining
